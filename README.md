# Visualize Skewed Normal Distributions

This simple Shiny Application lets you vary the shape of a skewed normal distribution. The case of a standard normal distribution is also included when skewness and location are 0 and scale is 1. 
You can play around with the parameters and see the shape of the curve change. At any time you can return to the standard normal case by pressing reset.
